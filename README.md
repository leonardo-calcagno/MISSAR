# MISSAR
The full code of the dynamic MIcrosimulation model of Social Security in ARgentina (MISSAR)

Version 1 of the MISSAR model was developed as part of my PhD thesis defended in the University of Orleans, France: 
"Argentina's social security system: a dynamic microsimulation model for projecting its sustainability, adequacy and redistributive impact"
The pdf of the thesis as well as the full code and dataset is hosted in ZENODO's digital repository service. The DOI is 10.5281/zenodo.1420273 , and the URL 
is https://zenodo.org/record/1420273?fbclid=IwAR1GKGC-ufEeuCqyCyD78TEsBZSv3NMZdUA7F-8a_CAsHZioTR-vAwQLsIA . I would recommend you read at least the readme 
file from the ZENODO's latest version to know what is going on here. 

You will find in this github the full code of the MISSAR model. The datasets used are stored in ZENODO, since these are far too heavy for github. 
This github will track any changes from MISSAR's version 1 developed for my PhD thesis and will be gradually updated with my work on newer versions of the model.
Once a newer version of the model is considered stable enough, it will be stored in Zenodo (together with the full dataset used) as a newer version of MISSAR. 

If you have any questions on the model, the code, or think you've spotted an error or a way to improve the model in any way, feel free to contact me and/or 
to propose any changes. I speak Spanish, French and English, so you can use any of these languages to get in touch. 

Be sure to check the changelog for features added or modified since Version 1.0. 

Thank you for reading this, I hope this model will be useful to you, and have fun!
